University of Saskatchewan: 

“Studies on the risks of neonicotinoids have often focused on bees that have been experiencing population declines. However, it is not just bees that are being affected by these
 insecticides,” said Christy Morrissey, U of S biology professor.

Research led by Margaret Eng, a post-doctoral fellow in Morrissey’s lab, is the first study to show that imidacloprid (neonicotinoid) and chlorpyrifos (organophosphate) —two of 
the most widely used insecticides worldwide—are directly toxic to seed-eating songbirds.
The paper, published in Scientific Reports, shows these chemicals can directly affect songbird migration.


“These chemicals are having a strong impact on songbirds.
We are seeing significant weight loss and the birds’ migratory orientation being significantly altered,” 
said Eng, who also worked with colleagues from York University. “Effects were seen from eating the equivalent of just 
three to four imidacloprid treated canola seeds or eight chlorpyrifos granules a day for three days.”



“What surprised us was how sensitive and rapid the effects were, particularly to imidacloprid,” said Morrissey.
“The birds showed a significant loss of body mass and signs of acute poisoning (lethargy and loss of appetite).
The migration trials also showed that birds completely failed to orient or changed their northward orientation.”


“We were encouraged that most birds survived, and could recover following the cessation of dosing,” said Eng. 
“But the effects we saw were severe enough that the birds would likely experience migratory delays or changes in their flight routes that could reduce
their chance of survival, or cause a missed breeding opportunity.”

Morrissey said that this research “could have major implications for regulation decisions of these pesticides.
Imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos are highly controversial for their safety to the environment or to humans and a decision on a proposed 
imidacloprid ban in Canada is being considered, with the federal government expected to make a decision on imidacloprid and its use in Canada sometime in December.”
