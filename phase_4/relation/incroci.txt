University of Saskatchewan: 

“Studies on the risks of neonicotinoids have often focused on bees that have been experiencing population declines. However, it is not just bees that are being affected by these
 insecticides,” said Christy Morrissey, U of S biology professor.

Research led by Margaret Eng, a post-doctoral fellow in Morrissey’s lab, is the first study to show that imidacloprid (neonicotinoid) and chlorpyrifos (organophosphate) —two of 
the most widely used insecticides worldwide—are directly toxic to seed-eating songbirds.
The paper, published in Scientific Reports, shows these chemicals can directly affect songbird migration.


“These chemicals are having a strong impact on songbirds.
We are seeing significant weight loss and the birds’ migratory orientation being significantly altered,” 
said Eng, who also worked with colleagues from York University. “Effects were seen from eating the equivalent of just 
three to four imidacloprid treated canola seeds or eight chlorpyrifos granules a day for three days.”
